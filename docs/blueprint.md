# **App Name**: Serbian Flash

## Core Features:

- Word List: Provide a static list of Serbian words to be translated. The list may be updated in future versions.
- Word Translation: Translate Serbian words to English using a generative AI tool such as Gemini; the translation will be shown on the reverse side of the card.
- Caching: Cache the translated words, reducing calls to the translation service.
- Flip Animation: Allow users to 'flip' the card (or use a button) to reveal the translation.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vivid red (#E63946), representing the boldness and vibrancy of the Serbian culture, while avoiding overly nationalistic tones.
- Background color: Light pink (#F1FAEE), a soft tone of the primary, offering contrast without overwhelming the interface.
- Accent color: Deep purple (#A8DADC), creating a rich but visually balanced scheme that evokes a sense of heritage.
- Headline font: 'Belleza', a stylish sans-serif for headlines.
- Body font: 'Alegreya', a classic serif for legibility.
- Simple, clear icons to indicate card status or provide hints.
- Clean layout, with Serbian text prominently displayed on one side of the flashcard, and the English translation on the other.
